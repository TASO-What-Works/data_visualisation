# TASO Data visualisation style guide - Supplementary code 

This repository contains example code for building charts with TASO stylings in R. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this respository is to share and collaborate on data visualisation code. We believe that data visualisation is an important tool for communicating insights and telling stories, and we want to make it easy for others to use our code.

This code is primarily targeted at TASO project partners. However, the code is set up so general audiences can take it and customise it to suit your own brand guidelines.

## Using and contributing 

The code in this repository is written in R. It is designed to be easy to use and understand. If you have any quesitons, please feel free to open an issue on GitHub.

If you would like to contribute, please fork this repository and create a pull request.

Alternatively, please contact luke.arundel@taso.org.uk if there is anything you would like to discuss.
